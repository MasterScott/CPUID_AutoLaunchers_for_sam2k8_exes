### CPUID AutoLaunchers for sam2k8 exes

Old automated launchers I did back in 2014 - 2015 for some CPUID protected games, based on sam2k8's cracked executables for a generous lot of AMD and Intel CPU models

------

- The launchers detect the CPU model from registry, then apply an xdelta3 patch for that model to a default cracked executable --- I used AMD FX 8350 as default CPU model
- I accomplished this by automatically generating xdelta3 patches and txt entries from sam2k8's cracked executables; this way you could use an almost universal crack taking just 10 - 30 MB of HDD space, instead of having to download and keep a few GB of cracked executables for all CPU models, the only solution available at that moment
- Given that sam2k8's cracked executables would take too much space, not to mention I don't even have them anymore, I've only included the AutoIt3 scripts I wrote to help me automatically generate the xd3 files and 'AMD Supported CPUs.txt' / 'Intel Supported CPUs.txt'
- As the executables also need certain versions of CODEX's Steam Emu and Steam006's LumaCEG plugin, the cracked packages are included here as 7z archives, for testing purposes only --- they only work with the specified versions and only on the CPU models listed in the txt files, so THEY ARE NOT TO BE USED NOW, as you can buy those games on various sites or Steam sales for very low prices, or use proper cracks if you wish so!
